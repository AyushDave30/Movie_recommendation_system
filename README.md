# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  
**A content-based recommendation system built with Streamlit and Python**  

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my project, where I’m learning Data Science by building a movie recommendation system from scratch. This project is inspired by @siddhardhan's YouTube tutorial, and I’ve added insights, explanations, and extra features to enhance learning.

This project is a web app that suggests movies based on user input. It uses a TF-IDF Vectorizer to analyze movie descriptions and calculate similarity scores with cosine similarity. The app is built with Streamlit for an interactive interface, allowing users to easily discover movies similar to their favorites.

Let’s explore, experiment, and learn together! 🚀 Suggestions and improvements are always welcome.

## 🔧 Tech Stack:  
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)  

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search for any movie title**  
- 🎯 **Get personalized recommendations**  
- 🖥️ **User-friendly web interface**  
- 📚 **Detailed code explanations in Jupyter Notebook**  
- 🛠 **Perfect for learning recommendation algorithms and deploying ML models as web apps!**

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`app.py`** — The main Python script for the Streamlit web app. It handles user input, calculates similarity scores, and displays movie recommendations in an interactive web interface.  
- **`movies.csv`** — The dataset containing movie titles and descriptions, used to build the recommendation system.  
- **`Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`** — Jupyter Notebook with detailed explanations and step-by-step implementation of the recommendation system. Perfect for understanding the logic, learning how the algorithm works, or experimenting with improvements.  
- **`requirements.txt`** — A list of required libraries. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary packages.  
- **`README.md`** — The project documentation (this file).
